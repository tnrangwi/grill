Code is far from doing anything useful apart from some test cases.
See file test.hs for what is working already.

COMPILATION

There is a quite simple makefile included. Run

make test

to pass the tests (which simply tries to run the test files) and

make

to create an executable running the tests. Creating the executable
may find problems during compilation that are not found by just
running the test case. This is object to more checks for e.g. filename
conventions done by ghc during compilation that are not done by runghc
used in the test program.

CREATING DOCUMENTATION

Run

make doc

to create the inline (haddock) documentation.

DO THE STUFF MANUALLY

If you do not have make up and running you can run

ghci --make demo/xyz.hs

for any file in the demo directory to compile and

demo/xyz.hs

to run any single test cases directly without using the compiled files - for any
file in the demo directory.
