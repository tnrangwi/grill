Version 0.0.1:

Rudimentary console GUI finished. The sheet still cannot be saved, but
it is possible to load sheets and change them with a rudimentary GUI.
Formula engine calculates whole sheets, two sheet functions implemented
for demonstration purposes. Nasty, you have to know what you are doing,
but it is worth setting from 0.0.0 to 0.0.1.
