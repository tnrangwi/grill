========

Possibly replace Plain with a (arbitrary type) and add constraints
to functions. This would make it possibly to turn tree and sheet
in a Monad for better use. Further on the whole implementation
get some functional style.

E.g. filling a sheet could then be done within the Monad. Plain may
be needed for properties but perhaps it is fully obsolete and a type
class instead of a type.
